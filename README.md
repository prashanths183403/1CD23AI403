  Modified to use TensorFlow’s built-in `cats_vs_dogs` dataset and updated preprocessing.

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning:**  
  Fixed Q-learning logic, improved reward handling, and ensured stable training.

- **LSTM – Time Series Forecasting:**  
  Cleaned data preprocessing and updated model definition for better execution.

- **RNN / LSTM – Text Generation:**  
  Replaced one-hot encoding with embedding layers and improved sequence handling.

- **Tic Tac Toe (Reinforcement Learning):**  
  Simplified state handling, corrected reward updates, and stabilized self-play training.
